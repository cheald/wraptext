But like any burgeoning movement, social good requires champions to bring it to the public and promote its growth.</p>
<p>While "social good" and "influence" may not have absolutely concrete definitions (is influence based on Twitter followers? Raising the most money?), it is easy to see when an individual has taken on the cause of social good to create some real change.  </p>
<p>Even though the exact parameters are a subjective call, we scoured the web for three social good activists who are using their skills to create change. We've highlighted three individuals who are utilizing social media and online campaigns to <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/09/social-media-activism/">shape the way that we think about activism</a>. </p>

<h2>1. The Free Agent</h2>
<hr>
<p>Beth Kanter and Allison Fine defined the concept of the "free agent" this year in their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Networked-Nonprofit-Connecting-Social-Change/dp/0470547979" target="_blank"><em>The Networked Nonprofit</em></a>. A "free agent," as they <a href="http://www.bethkanter.org/lightbulb-fortress-freeagent/" target="_Blank"> defined it</a>, is a "person who is passionate about a social cause, but is working outside of a nonprofit organization to organize, mobilize, raise money, and engage with others." Using social media tools, free agents are able to make an impact that was once only capable within the infrastructure of an organization.</p>
<p>We've covered a number of <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/05/youtube-projects-social-good/">free agents</a> who had influence this year. Individuals like <a href="http://uncultured.com/" target="_blank">Shawn Ahmed</a>, who posts <a href="http://mashable.com/category/youtube/">YouTube</a> videos about poverty in Bangladesh; Mark Horvath, who gives homelessness a voice through his <a href="http://wearevisible.com/" target="_blank">We Are Visible</a> and <a href="http://invisiblepeople.tv/blog/" target="_blank">Invisible People</a> projects; and even Dan Savage, who launched the <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/21/dan-savage-youtube/">It Gets Better Project</a> in September to support gay teens who face adversity.</p>
<p>Kanter, a free agent <a href="http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/01/birthday-campaign-reflection-creating-a-culture-of-giving-in-your-network.html" target="_blank">herself</a>, has played an influential role in helping non-profit organizations accept and cooperate with these social media-powered activists. Among her efforts, she <a href="http://www.bethkanter.org/techatstate/" target="_blank">facilitated a conversation at the State Department's </a><a href="http://techatstate.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Tech@State Civil Society 2.0</a> event about how non-profits and free agents can work together.</p>

<h2>2. Ben Rattray, Founder and CEO of Change.org</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are two hurdles that almost every cause campaign struggles with. The first is making the complexities and realities of its cause understood. The second is mobilizing people effectively. <a href="http://www.change.org" target="_blank">Change.org</a>, which was founded by Ben Rattray in 2006, helps solve both. </p>
<p>The site has more than 100 writers who contribute in-depth reporting on 15 different causes. When people come to the site to read about a cause they're passionate about, they also have the opportunity to take action toward that cause by signing petitions. While these cumulative actions lack the drama of a protest, mobilizing a large network toward one specific action has proved a lot more effective than a hodgepodge of independent actions. </p>
<p>Change.org has partnered with thousands of non-profits, and together the community has accomplished more than <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions?order=victories" target="_blank">100 "victories,"</a> in which they've changed an unjust practice, law or policy. The organization connects activists with similar passions, and by doing so it gives them power as a cohort that they would never have as individuals.</p>

<h2>3. Scott Harrison, Founder of Charity: Water</h2>
<hr>
<p>Charity: water uses 100% of public donations to fund water projects and is transparent about how donations are used. Both of these qualities make it somewhat of an oddball in the non-profit world -- which might be exactly what the non-profit world needs.</p>
<p>When people donate money to most organizations, they're not sure what happens to their donation or how efficiently it was used. When they give to charity: water, they can <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/projects/map/" target="_blank">look up a picture and GPS coordinates</a> of the project they contributed to. Since the organization relies on private donors for the money that makes it run, there's no doubt about whether your donation ended up paying for somebody's flight instead of funding a water project. The organization even covers its PayPal fees on donations. </p>
<p>This model of transparency and accountability has created trust and helped raise more than $20 million for 3,196 projects in the past four years. We hope that its success will influence other non-profits to do the same.</p>
